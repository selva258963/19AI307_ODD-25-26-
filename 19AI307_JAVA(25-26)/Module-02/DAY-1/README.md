# Ex.No:2(A) CLASS AND OBJECT

## QUESTION:
Create a class Car with attributes brand, model, year. Create 2 objects and print their details.


## AIM:
To write a Java program to implement Classes and Objects using a Car class and display details of two car objects.



## ALGORITHM :
1.Start the program.

2.Import the necessary package java.util (if required).

3.Create a class named Car.

4.Declare data members: brand, model, year.

5.Create a parameterized constructor to initialize values.

6.In the main function, create two objects of class Car.

7.Print the details of both objects.

8.End the program.





## PROGRAM:

}
public class prog {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car();
        car1.brand = "Toyota";
        car1.model = "Innova";
        car1.year = 2022;

        Car car2 = new Car();
        car2.brand = "Hyundai";
        car2.model = "i20";
        car2.year = 2021;

        System.out.println("Car 1: " + car1.brand + " " + car1.model + " " + car1.year);
        System.out.println("Car 2: " + car2.brand + " " + car2.model + " " + car2.year);
    }
}
```
